# What is a seed phrase?

&#x20;A seed phrase in cryptocurrency consists of 12, 15, or 24 words that act as a master key to unlock and recover your crypto wallet. This phrase contains all necessary details to restore and access your funds. In case of wallet loss, damage, or forgotten passwords, your seed phrase allows you to regain access to your cryptocurrency. Protect your seed phrase diligently, as its exposure could lead to the loss of all your assets. **Never share it and only input it in trusted wallets.**
