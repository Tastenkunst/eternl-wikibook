# Common mistakes to avoid

When handling and securely storing seed phrases, there are common mistakes that should be avoided to ensure the safety of your crypto assets. One major error is taking or keeping digital photos of your seed phrase. Photos stored on devices are vulnerable to hacks, malware, or unauthorized access, potentially revealing your seed phrase. Instead, consider writing your seed phrase down physically on paper and storing it in a secure, offline location. For enhanced durability and protection against environmental damage, you can use stainless steel versions designed specifically for storing seed phrases. These metal backups can withstand fire, water, and other damaging conditions, thereby protecting your seed phrase from both digital and physical threats. It's also crucial to avoid saving any digital copy of the seed phrase in cloud services or digital note-taking apps, as they can be compromised and lead to loss of funds.



When using hot wallets, it's important to create and maintain a strong spending password. This password is used to authorize transactions, adding an additional layer of security to your crypto assets. However, because spending passwords must be entered / inserted manually, they are susceptible to additional risks like malware and keyloggers, which can capture your input and compromise your security. To mitigate these risks, ensure that your device is protected with reliable antivirus software and keep your operating system and applications up to date. Consider using hardware wallets for increased security when handling substantial amounts and always be cautious of phishing attempts that may trick you into entering your password on fraudulent websites.
