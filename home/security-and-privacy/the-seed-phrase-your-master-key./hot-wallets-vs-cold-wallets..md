# Hot wallets vs cold wallets.

**Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets**: Choosing between hot wallets and cold wallets is vital for securing cryptocurrencies, based on your needs and desired security level.&#x20;

**Hot wallets** are internet-connected digital wallets that offer convenience for frequent transactions; Eternl v2.0 for example supports integrations with hardware wallets for enhanced security.

On the other hand, **cold wallets** function offline, reducing hack risks. Hardware wallets like Ledger Nano S, Trezor, and Keystone are common choices. Eternl v2.0 supports these hardware wallets, with more integrations planned, making it adaptable and secure for user needs. Investing in a hardware wallet is advisable when you manage amounts exceeding the hardware's cost.

Regardless of the wallet type, safeguarding the **seed phrase** is essential, as losing it can permanently prevent access to your assets. Always store the seed phrase securely offline to protect from digital and physical threats.
