## &#x20;Common Mistakes to Avoid

Protecting your crypto assets begins with understanding how to properly handle and store your **seed phrase** and credentials. Below are common mistakes users should avoid — along with safer alternatives.

---

### &#x20;Avoid Digital Photos of Your Seed Phrase

Never take a screenshot or photo of your seed phrase. Storing images on phones or computers exposes them to:

* Malware and hacks
* Unauthorized access
* Cloud service breaches

> &#x20;**Safer Alternative:** Write the seed phrase **on paper** and store it securely offline.

---

### &#x20;Use Metal Backups for Long-Term Security

To protect your seed from physical damage:

* Use stainless steel plates or specialized metal backups
* Resistant to fire, water, corrosion, and physical degradation

> Great for long-term HODLers or secure cold storage.

---

### &#x20;Never Save Your Seed Digitally

Avoid saving your seed phrase in:

* Cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)
* Note-taking apps
* Screenshots or email drafts

> Any digital record can be breached or leaked.

---

### &#x20;Use Strong Spending Passwords (Hot Wallets)

When using hot wallets like Eternl:

* Set a **strong, unique spending password**
* Used to **authorize transactions** and prevent unauthorized access

> But beware: passwords are still vulnerable to digital threats.

---

### &#x20;Defend Against Malware and Keyloggers

Spending passwords can be intercepted by:

* Malware
* Keyloggers
* Phishing websites

#### &#x20;Best Practices:

* Use **antivirus software**
* Keep your system and browser **up to date**
* Avoid clicking suspicious links or popups
* Use **hardware wallets** for large holdings

> &#x20;**Tip:** Stay informed. Most losses happen due to small oversights, not sophisticated attacks.
