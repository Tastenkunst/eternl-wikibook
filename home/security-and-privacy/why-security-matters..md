# Why security matters.

Security is paramount in the crypto world due to the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of blockchain technology, which, while offering transparency, also presents unique risks. \
Without a centralized authority to oversee transactions, the onus falls on individuals to secure their assets. A single security oversight can lead to irrecoverable financial losses, as cryptocurrencies are susceptible to hacking, phishing, and other cyber threats. \
