# Why security matters.

Security is paramount in the crypto world due to the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of blockchain technology, which, while offering transparency, also presents unique risks. Without a centralized authority to oversee transactions, the onus falls on individuals to secure their assets. A single security oversight can lead to irrecoverable financial losses, as cryptocurrencies are susceptible to hacking, phishing, and other cyber threats. Additionally, the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions means any unauthorized transaction cannot be undone, further underscoring the need for robust security measures.
