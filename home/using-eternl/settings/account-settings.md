#### Cardano Public Account Key Formats

Cardano supports several public account key formats, each used to view wallet information but **not to sign transactions**. When imported, these keys create **read-only wallets**:

* **`acct_xvk`**: A Cardano-specific extended account public key (Bech32), including both the public key and chain code. Used for deriving address keys in hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.
* **`xpub`**: A general extended public key (Base58 or hex) from standards like BIP32, also containing a chain code. Used for address derivation across various wallet systems.
* **`acct_vk`**: A non-extended account public key (Bech32) that includes only the public key. Used for viewing wallet details or verifying signatures.

These key formats enable wallet **monitoring and address generation**, but **cannot be used to access funds or sign transactions**.

<summary>Single Address Mode (SAM) [option]</summary>

### Only use a single address for all transactions.

When enabled, all funds will be held on the first receive address by default.

<summary>Collateral [option]</summary>

### Use Eternl provided collateral?

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Option switch Collateral</p></figcaption></figure>



### Collateral (Cardano)

#### What is Collateral?

In the Cardano blockchain, **collateral** is a special UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) set aside to cover transaction fees if a smart contract (Plutus script) **fails** during execution.

* ‚úÖ If the script **succeeds**, the collateral is untouched.
* ‚ùå If the script **fails**, the collateral is used to pay the **transaction fee only**, not the full amount.

This system ensures users are responsible for failed executions, helping to protect the network from spam or abuse.

> üîì The **collateral is never locked.** It can still be spent in any transaction that does **not** require a collateral.

***

#### Using Collateral in Eternl

The **Eternl wallet** provides a feature called the **Collateral**.

> When the Collateral Switch is **ON**, Eternl will automatically select a suitable UTxO to be used as collateral‚Äîif available in your wallet.

This means:

* You don‚Äôt need to manually choose a collateral UTxO.
* Interactions with smart contracts and dApps are handled smoothly.
* The selected collateral is only used **if a contract execution fails**, and only to cover **fees**.

> üõ°Ô∏è This helps ensure secure and seamless usage of smart contracts on Cardano through the Eternl wallet.

***

### Summary

* Collateral is **required** for transactions involving Plutus smart contracts.
* Collateral is **never locked** and can be spent in regular (non-contract) transactions.
* Eternl automates collateral management when the **Collateral Switch** is enabled.
* Collateral UTxOs are only consumed **if a transaction fails**, and only to cover **fees**.

<summary>Manual sync [option]</summary>

### Set manual sync

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/manual_sync (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Manual sync option</p></figcaption></figure>



### What is Manual Sync?

In Eternl, **Manual Sync** is an optional setting that allows you to control **when** your wallet fetches the latest data (such as balances, UTxOs, and transaction history) from the blockchain.

By default, this setting is **OFF**, meaning the wallet performs **automatic syncing** in the background.

***

### üîÅ Automatic Sync (Default)

* The wallet refreshes data **automatically** at regular intervals.
* Keeps balances and UTxOs **up to date** without user input.
* Convenient for most users.

***

### ‚úã Manual Sync (When turned ON)

When enabled, syncing will **only occur when you manually trigger it** by pressing the **sync button** in the interface.

***

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Manual Sync

* ‚ö° **Faster UI response**: Reduces background activity, especially useful on low-power devices or slow networks.
* üîí **More control**: Ideal for advanced users who want to control when blockchain state updates.
* üß™ **Useful in testing/debugging scenarios**, where state consistency is critical.

***

### ‚ùå Disadvantages of Manual Sync

* üïí **Outdated balances**: You may see stale wallet data until you manually sync.
* üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Extra effort**: Requires remembering to sync before sending transactions or interacting with dApps.
* ‚ùå **May cause confusion**: New users might not realize data isn‚Äôt current.

***

### Summary

| Mode                    | Sync Method         | Best For                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Automatic** (default) | Background sync     | Most users (easy & up to date)             |
| **Manual**              | User-triggered sync | Power users, low-resource devices, testing |



> üí° **Tip:** If you're unsure, it's best to leave Manual Sync **off** for a smoother experience.

<summary>history sync [option]</summary>

###

### Set history sync

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/history_sync.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **History Sync** option controls whether your Eternl wallet **syncs your full transaction history** with the blockchain.

> When **enabled**, Eternl will fetch your complete historical activity (incoming/outgoing transactions, metadata, etc.).

***

#### üîç What is History Sync?

Cardano wallets can operate with **minimal sync** (just balances and UTxOs) or with **full history sync**. This setting determines which mode Eternl uses.

* üîÑ **ON**: Full transaction history is retrieved and displayed.
* üí§ **OFF**: Only your current balance and available UTxOs are shown ‚Äî not past transactions.

***

#### ‚úÖ Advantages of History Sync (ON)

* üìú See your full transaction history in-app
* üîç Useful for auditing, record keeping, or tax purposes
* üß† Easier to track smart contract interactions or NFT transfers

***

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages

* üê¢ **Slower sync time**, especially for older or busy wallets
* üîã Higher memory and data usage
* Not needed for simple transfers or light use

***

#### üìå Summary Table

| Setting           | Sync Behavior                      | Best For                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **ON**            | Full transaction history is synced | Power users, bookkeeping, audits   |
| **OFF** (default) | Faster sync, no history loaded     | Everyday users, faster performance |

> üí° **Tip:** If you just need to send/receive ADA or NFTs, you can leave this **OFF** for quicker syncs.

***

### üß≠ Recommendation

Enable **History Sync** if:

* You need to track past transactions or use the wallet for business or DeFi.
* You‚Äôre troubleshooting contract calls or asset transfers.

Keep it **disabled** if:

* You want the wallet to load quickly and don‚Äôt need old records.

## üß©Token Fragmentation (TF)

### Reduce transaction fees by fragmenting tokens.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/token_fragmentation.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Token Fragmentation (TF)

**Token Fragmentation** is an advanced sending option that controls how tokens are grouped when a transaction is made.

> When enabled, the wallet will **split tokens into bundles** if the number of tokens in the **change output** exceeds a defined threshold.

> üß© **Default value:** `20` tokens per UTxO

#### üîç Purpose

This helps **reduce UTxO bloat** and improves **token management** by avoiding overly large token bundles in change.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

* During a transaction, if the wallet detects that the change output would include **more tokens than the set limit**, it will **automatically split** them into smaller, more manageable outputs.
* This behavior depends on your wallet‚Äôs current **UTxO and token distribution**.

#### üéØ Tweaking for Best Results

To get optimal results:

* You may need to **adjust the threshold value** based on your wallet‚Äôs token composition.
* Different distributions may require different configurations to achieve the desired outcome.

***

> üí° **Tip:** Token Fragmentation can help avoid failed transactions caused by oversized outputs or complex UTxO sets.

### üì¶ Token Bundle Size

The **Token Bundle Size** setting defines the **maximum number of tokens** each UTxO output should contain when tokens are fragmented.

> üß© **Default value:** `20` tokens per UTxO\
> üîß This value is adjustable based on your specific needs.

#### üìä What does it affect?

Changing this value affects how tokens are distributed across outputs when sending transactions:

* **Lowering the value (<20):**
  * Splits tokens into **smaller bundles**
  * ‚ö° **Lower transaction fees**
  * üîí **More ADA locked** in multiple UTxOs
* **Increasing the value (>20):**
  * Groups more tokens per UTxO
  * üí∏ **Higher transaction fees**
  * üîì **Less ADA locked**, more efficient for frequent use

> ‚öñÔ∏è **Tip:** Lower values are better for minimizing fees in simple wallets. Higher values can be more efficient for wallets handling many tokens or dApp interactions.

## Advanced UTxO Management

### Use advanced UTxO management on your transactions.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### üß† Advanced UTxO Management

When this feature is **enabled**, Eternl applies advanced logic to optimize how your wallet handles UTxOs during transactions.

* üîÑ It attempts to maintain at least **10 available UTxOs** to support **parallel transaction execution**, improving performance and responsiveness.
* üõ°Ô∏è Additionally, it tries to reserve a dedicated **5 \{{currency\}} collateral UTxO** for use with **smart contract interactions**.

> ‚öôÔ∏è This setting is especially useful for users interacting with dApps, submitting multiple transactions, or participating in DeFi.

### Auto Withdrawal

Automatically withdraw rewards if needed.
