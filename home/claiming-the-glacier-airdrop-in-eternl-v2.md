<summary><strong>PHASE 2: SCAVENGER MINE (CLOSED! Oct 29th to Nov 19th)**</strong></summary>

Missed the Glacier Drop window? Want to play a bigger part in the future of Midnight? **Scavenger Mine is here and everyone can join!**

This phase reallocates all tokens unclaimed from the Glacier Drop. It is open to everyone, requires **no prerequisites or eligibility criteria**, and specialized hardware is **not required**.

> **Phase Dates**: The Scavenger Mine is live from **October 29th until November 19th (21 days total)**. {.is-info}

> **What You Do**: You participate by having your device automatically solve cryptographic challenges in the background to earn an allocation of $NIGHT tokens. {.is-info}

**⚙️ How to Participate and Start Mining:**

1. **Go to the Website**: Navigate to the claim portal at `claim.midnight.gd` and select the **Scavenger Mine** tab.
2. **Choose a Destination Address**:
   * Connect using a verified Cardano wallet (like Eternl) **OR** enter your Destination address manually.
3. **Accept Terms**: Read and accept the **Token End User Terms**.
4. **Sign Message**: Sign the unique claim message. This registers your address and binds it to your current browser session.
5. **Click Start Session**: Click **Start session** to begin. Your Scavenger Mine instance will start looking for solutions to the most current challenge for as long as your device/browser is running (or until the end of the claim phase).

**📊 Scavenger Mine Mechanics (How You Earn):**

* **24h Claim Cycles**: The event is structured into **21 distinct claim cycles**, each lasting 24 hours. The total token pool for this phase is divided equally across these cycles.
* **Solving Challenges**: Your device automatically accepts, solves, and submits cryptographic challenges in the background. The system issues one new challenge per hour, totaling 24 challenges per cycle.
* **Determining Allocation**: Your final token allocation for a cycle is **proportional** to the number of solutions your device submitted relative to the total solutions submitted by all participants in that specific 24-hour cycle.

<summary><strong>PHASE 3: REDEEM (OPEN until 05. December 2026)</strong></summary>

#### Redemption period (360 days)

Wait for your allocation(s) to thaw Allocations must thaw before they can be redeemed.

During the **Redemption period**, token allocations thaw and become **redeemable**. Successfully-claimed token allocations during Glacier Drop and Scavenger Mine are initially frozen (locked). Allocations thaw (unlock) following a staggered schedule in four equally-spaced, 25% installments over the course of 360 days.

For each individual allocation, the first thaw falls randomly between days 1 and 90, with subsequent thaws following every 90 days.

### What you need to do

* At each thaw, a 25% share of the allocation unlocks
* Each thawed share can be individually redeemed as it unlocks
* After the last thaw, the full allocation is unlocked and available for redemption

> Claimants can wait until the last thaw to claim their full allocations in one go {.is-info}

### Redeem your allocation

To complete the process and receive your NIGHT, you must redeem your allocation after it thaws.

> Dates to be confirmed (360 days) {.is-info}

Redeeming is the act of transferring thawed tokens into your Destination address during the Redemption period. It’s the final step to complete the process and receive the tokens claimed during Glacier Drop and/or Scavenger Mine.

You may choose to redeem each share of your allotted tokens as they thaw, or wait until they fully unlock to redeem the whole allocation at once. Each redemption involves a Cardano transaction, requiring you to cover the cost of the Cardano network transaction fee.

### How to redeem your allocation

#### 01. Access the NIGHT Claim Portal

The NIGHT Claim Portal is the official user interface of the NIGHT token distribution. Through the Portal, you can participate in the Glacier Drop and Scavenger Mine claim phases, and later on redeem your claimed allocation(s).

#### 02. Enter or connect Destination address wallet

#### 03. Check if your token allocation has thawed

#### 04. Redeem thawed tokens

### What happens next

After the Redemption period ends, the NIGHT Claim Portal may be taken offline, and any un-redeemed allocations must be manually redeemed by their owners.
