While you cannot directly transfer the wallet itself to a hardware device, you can securely move your assets to a new wallet created on a hardware device, such as through Eternl wallet.

Essentially, you would be setting up a new wallet on the hardware device and then transferring your cryptocurrency assets from your old wallet to this new one. This process ensures that your assets are managed through a hardware wallet for enhanced security, although the original wallet's configuration is not moved but recreated on the hardware device
