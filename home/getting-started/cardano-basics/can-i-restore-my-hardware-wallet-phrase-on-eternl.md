# Can I restore my hardware wallet phrase on Eternl?

Eternl, the Cardano Community wallet, has many useful features like bringing back old wallets using a recovery phrase. That said, not all seed phrases are created equally, for example Ledger uses a custom format, which intentionally is not supported to restore within Eternl.

However, it's not a good idea to use your hardware wallet's recovery phrase on Eternl or any other software wallet to set it up for regular use.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Doing this goes against the main reason you'd use a hardware wallet in the first place.\
Hardware wallets are made to keep your digital money safe by storing your details offline, away from hackers.
{% endhint %}

When you put your hardware wallet's recovery phrase into a software wallet, you risk making it less secure. It's always best to use another hardware wallet if you need to recover your account.
