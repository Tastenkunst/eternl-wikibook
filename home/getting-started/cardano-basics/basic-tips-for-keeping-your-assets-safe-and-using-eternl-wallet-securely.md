# Basic tips for keeping your assets safe and using Eternl Wallet securely

<details>

<summary><strong>1. What is Cardano?</strong></summary>

Cardano is a blockchain that focuses on being secure and flexible. It was made using science and research. Its main goals are to be sustainable, work reliably, and be clear about how it works. Cardano is open to everyone and wants to help people worldwide, especially those without bank services. It uses a special computer language to make sure it is very secure. Cardano is also creating a system for smart contracts, which are agreements that work automatically, to support new kinds of apps and to keep improving over time.

### 1.1 Cardano's ADA

Digital currency: ADA is Cardano's digital money. Like other digital currencies, you can buy, sell, and exchange ADA. It serves as a way to keep value and helps with fast, cheap money transfers, similar to other digital currencies.

Fuel for operations: ADA is needed to run things on Cardano's network. For example, to use a smart contract on Cardano, you pay with ADA. This use of ADA as 'fuel' helps keep the network running by encouraging those involved to process transactions and confirm blocks.

### 1.2 Cardano’s Vision

Bringing change: Cardano wants to make a difference in the real world. Its aim is to give financial services to those who don't have bank accounts, make voting more secure, and develop ways for people to safely keep their personal information.

### 1.3 The Community and Governance

Decentralization: Cardano aims for no single person or group to control it. It does this through a special way of making decisions, where people who own ADA can help decide its future. An important part of this are ADA staking pools, which help spread out the power of managing transactions and creating new blocks, so no one person or group is in charge. There are over 3,000 of these pools helping to keep Cardano running smoothly and securely. Please see our article "How to participate in Blockchain Governance " to learn more about governance and decentralized decision making.

Open participation: Anyone with ADA can help make decisions for Cardano. This means everyone has a chance to share their opinion. ADA owners can vote on changes or offer their ADA to a staking pool, or even start their own pool. This is not just for earning rewards but also plays a big role in how Cardano is run, as it affects which pools get to create blocks and have a say in the network.

Understanding ADA staking pools in Cardano shows us the blockchain is about building a fair digital world for all, not just technology. With many staking pools and chances for ADA owners to join, Cardano shows its dedication to shared control and people-powered governance. For more about staking, see "How staking works"

<summary><strong>2. The (e)UTxO model</strong></summary>

### 2.1 What is the (e)UTxO Model?

The (e)UTxO model in Cardano, inspired by Bitcoin's reliable UTxO system which has worked well for over a decade, introduces improvements. It keeps Bitcoins strengths in handling transactions securely and efficiently but adds the ability to include more data in transactions, like smart contracts. This makes Cardano's blockchain more versatile, allowing for complex transactions and applications, while maintaining high security and performance standards.

The model also offers flexibility in transaction conditions, expanding the types of applications that can be developed on Cardano, especially those needing detailed transaction logic.

### 2.2 Why is (e)UTxO Important?

* More than just storing money In Cardano, the (e)UTxO model doesn't just keep track of how much digital currency someone has. It also stores rules about how that money can be spent. This is especially useful for things like smart contracts.
* Security and efficiency The (e)UTxO model stands out for its security, ensuring transactions comply with set rules, and efficiency, by processing multiple transactions simultaneously. Moreover, its underlying UTxO mode has a proven track record as the longest tested account model as it is utilized by Bitcoin for over a decade without issues.
* Determinism Determinism in handling transactions and scripts means everything is predictable. This ensures a user knows in advance how their transaction will affect the blockchains state, avoiding surprises like failed script validations, unexpected fees or unanticipated changes in the ledger or script states.

<summary>3. Don't keep cryptocurrency on exchange sites</summary>

If you want to keep your cryptocurrency safe for a long time, it's better to use your own personal wallets instead of leaving them on exchange sites. Personal wallets are safer because they have fewer risks than exchanges. Exchanges can sometimes be hacked or have other big problems. Past incidents like what happened with Mt. Gox and FTX show how dangerous it can be to keep a lot of cryptocurrency in wallets on exchange sites for too long. **Not your keys, not your crypto.**

<summary>4. Use two-step verification (2FA)</summary>

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is like adding a second authentication method to your online accounts. It makes it harder for someone else to gain access to your accounts. When you use 2FA, you need two different ways to prove it's you. This could be something like a password and then a code shown in your authenticator app.

<summary>5. Check who contacts you</summary>

Be careful about people who contact you and make sure they are who they say they are. This helps you avoid scams and phishing (tricks to get your personal information). When someone messages you on social media, be extra careful. If you need help or have questions, it's a good idea to use Discord channels that are related to the topic you're interested in. Remember, no real company or their workers will ever ask you for your seed phrase and usually won’t initiate private message contact with you.

<summary>6. Use a VPN to keep your online activities private</summary>

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps to keep your online activities private and safe, especially when you're doing things like buying or selling online or using your online wallet. A VPN hides what you do on the internet by changing your internet connection to make it secret and secure. This means it's hard for anyone to see or track what you're doing online. But it's very important to choose a VPN service that is reliable and doesn't keep records of your online activities. This helps to make sure your privacy and safety are well-protected.

<summary>7. Hot wallet vs cold wallet</summary>

In the context of crypto, a hot wallet and a cold wallet refer to two types of cryptocurrency storage methods with different security and connectivity features:

### 7.1 Hot Wallet

A hot wallet is connected to the internet. It's easier to use for buying, selling, and managing your crypto. But since it’s online, it can be at risk of being hacked. These dangers can lead to someone getting into your wallet and possibly stealing your crypto. If you use a hot wallet, you should be careful and use good security steps like strong passwords and keeping the wallet software updated.

### 7.2 Cold Wallet

A cold wallet is different because it's not connected to the internet. It's used to keep your credentials safe and is generally more secure than a hot wallet.

Hardware wallets are small physical devices that keep your private keys (like secret codes for your crypto) safe and offline. This makes it hard for hackers to get to them.

> ### Good Things About Hardware Wallets:
>
> Better Security: They're not connected to the internet, so they're safe from online hacking. Control Over Your Keys: You have full control of your private keys. Strong and Lasting: They are made to be tough and long-lasting. Can Hold Many Types of Crypto: They usually support different cryptocurrencies, not just ADA. {.is-success}

> ### Downsides Of Hardware Wallets:
>
> Cost: They cost more than free hot wallets (online wallets). Less Convenient: Not as easy to use for frequent trading or quick transactions. Risk of Losing or Breaking Them: They can be lost, stolen, or broken because they're physical objects. {.is-info}

For people who trade a lot or need fast access to their ADA, hot wallets (online wallets) are more practical, but they have some security risks. However, for big transactions and keeping your crypto safe for a long time, it's better to use hardware wallets like Trezor, Ledger, and Keystone. These wallets are known for being really secure and they lower the risk of online dangers. Also, these hardware wallets work with the Eternl wallet, which makes them even more useful for Cardano users.
