## v2.0.10.5

{% hint style="info" %}
Released 05.08.2025
{% endhint %}

### Governance

Bulk voting (first iteration) on proposals is here. DReps can now prepare their votes and cast them in a single transaction.

For DReps using Ledger devices, you can only cast a single vote per transaction. As a workaround, you could get a Keystone device, enter your Ledger seed phrase, change derivation on the Keystone device to Ledger and use that to cast all your votes in a single transaction.

### Web URIs

Eternl now supports URLs in the form of web+cardano://

This includes CIP-0013, CIP-0099, CIP-0157, CIP-0158

Simple payment requests, POO claims, advanced payment requests (prefilling the Send page with values for ADA, token, and comments) and opening the DApp Browser with a given URL. You can try it out using the new QR-Scanner option in the header or main menu.

### Apex Fusion

* Added support for the new Vector testnet.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

### Added

* Ada Handle resolution of decentralized minted handles (DeMi)
* Failed transaction status (very rare on-chain)
* Export/Import wallet as QR code: makes it easy to transfer wallets from one device to another, e.g. from Desktop to mobile. Keep in mind, that for 'hot wallets' the encrypted (by spending password) private key is also shared.
* Added CSwap to MonsterSwap
* Added a bottom banner to get more user participation for governance.

### Changed

* Transaction list filter: Enter a token name (hit ENTER), enter another token name (hit ENTER) to filter for multiple tokens at the same time.

## v1.11.0

> Released 29.07.2023\
> {.is-info}

Currently in review: Browser extension, iOS app, Android app

This overhaul was necessary to lay the foundation for Eternl v2.\
Now that this milestone is reached, we can focus on the new design of v2.

### Changes/Additions

Smart Chaining!\
Any transaction submitted through Eternl will now be considered when signing additional transactions, allowing for chaining of multiple transactions at the same time. Please note: This only works when they're not (only) submitted through a DApps own endpoint.

Connect everything!\
Eternl allows DApps to connect using CardanoConnect (CIP-45 - P2P) and WalletConnect!\
We invite all DApps to implement CardanoConnect to offer a decentralized connection solution on #Cardano.

Assets\
Eternl now has new logic for storing token data and fetching their details on-demand. We also added support for CIP-68 tokens!

Send UI\
This new Send page replaces the old TxBuilder, allowing you to send to multiple recipients. Resolving ADA Handles also got an overhaul, integrating it more seamlessly.

Transactions\
The details of transactions are now loaded on demand. Pending transactions have been merged into the transaction list to have everything going on in one place.

Address Book\
Before, we used to have wallet specific and a global address book. To make this feature more accessible and easier to use, it has now been merged into one app-wide address book, giving you easier access.

Settings\
Wallet and account settings have been split into their own sections, making what setting applies to an account more transparent. Some settings have been removed, e.g., pending transaction auto-removal, as this is now handled automatically.

A huge thank you goes out to the whole team. This milestone is paramount! With this out of the way, we will focus our efforts on the new design. Stay tuned!

Also:

* Removed locking wallets individually. We will add an app PIN code to v2 though.
* New settings: Transaction History Sync. Enable it to be able to export CSV and use advanced filtering on the Tx History page.
* Removed ADAHandle allowlist/blocklist (use address book instead)

### Known issues

* Clicking Register on the Voting page does not open a transaction to sign
